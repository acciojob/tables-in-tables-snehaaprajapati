		 Your task is to create an HTML table layout with multiple nested tables and lists that closely resemble the structure shown in the image: 
	  </p>

	  <img src="https://cdn.acciojob.com/questions-data/Screenshot%202023-01-31%20at%202.42.55%20PM.png" alt="image">

	  <p>Here are the requirements:</p>

	  
    <table style="width: 100%; height: 100%">
      <!-- Your code here -->
		<tr>
			<th>
		  Requirement
	  </th>
		  <th>
		  Description
		  </th>
		</tr>
      
<tr>
	<td>
		Nested Tables	
	</td>
	<td>
		Create 4 nested tables within a main table. Follow the image for layout.
	</td>
</tr>

 <tr>
	<td>
		Headers	
	</td>
	<td>
		Each nested table should have specific headers. For example, one table should have "Nested Table 2," "Column 1," "Column 2" as headers.
	</td>
</tr>	
 <tr>
	<td>
	  Lists
	</td>
	<td>
		Include a list in one of the tables with the items "List item 1," "List item 2," "List item 3.
	</td>
</tr>
		<tr>
	<td>
	  Background Color
	</td>
	<td>
	     One of the cells in the nested tables should have a black background with white text that contains "HTML."
	</td>
</tr>	

		<p>
			Ensure that your HTML code closely follows the structure in the image, and submit your completed work for evaluation.
